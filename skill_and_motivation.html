											Since studying at university and working in the game industry, I have gradually acquired skills in various aspects.
										</p>

										<p>
											In computer science, I have grasped basic data structures and algorithms, along with the ability to use multiple programming languages for software development.
											Although I haven't conducted formal scientific research in a laboratory, I have acquired fundamental knowledge in computer vision and computer graphics.
											Additionally, I have experience in implementing and replicating some classic research papers in these fields.
										</p>

										<p>
											In software engineering, during my time working for NetEase and Lilith Games, I developed several internal engine plugins and design tools.
											Beyond enhancing basic rendering capabilities, I also focused on improving the usability of these tools, which received positive feedback from users.
										</p>

										<p>
											Regarding the ability to use design tools, I am proficient in using mainstream design software, including but not limited to Blender, Substance Designer, and Houdini.
											In my current role, I have expertise in creating materials and shaders, using shader languages to achieve specific visual effects.
											In terms of game development, I am highly proficient with several commercial game engines such as Unity and Unreal.
											Additionally, due to the requirement of using an internal engine, I have gained knowledge about DirectX architecture.
										</p>

										<p>
											Looking ahead, I still want to work in the game industry.
											While I am passionate about the role of a technical artist, the evolving technologies motivate me to enhance my knowledge and broaden my technical horizons through a graduate program.
											Through this program, I aim to further strengthen my computer science skills and advance my career prospects in the future.
