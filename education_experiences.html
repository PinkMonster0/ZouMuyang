											In 2016, I entered Shanghaitech University, majoring in computer science. After the first year's basic computer science courses, I got interested in coding, especially on projects with beautiful visual effect. In spare time, I also learned the skills of using game engines by myself.
											After that, I made sure my aspiration in Computer Graphics and Game Development. I actively participated in the game technical lectures and gamejams. Also, I took several electives in Computer Graphics and Computer Vision.
											These courses and activities helped me to find my interest in rendering technique.
										</p>

										<p>
											Art is another interest of mine. Fortunately, ShanghaiTech founded the School of Creativity and Art(SCA) in 2017. I was among the first group of students who took courses of SCA. During the whole college time, I had taken Western Art History, Entertainment Design,
											User Experience Design and many other courses. And I became the teaching assistant of Experimental Animation course in Spring 2019.
										</p>

										<p>
 											Beyond the courses, I tried to find opportunities to work in game industry.In the summer of 2018, I got my first practice opportunity in Shanghai Hyron Software.
											I worked as level designer intern in a game studio of Hyron for two months, produced a project named 'Little Fist Combat'.Unfortunately, this game did not make it to the market due to the game license issues.
											Nevertheless, I learned the operations of a small game studio in China through this internship experience.

											Because of winning the First Prize of NetEase College Mini Game Competetion, I got a technical artist intern offer in 2019 summer. NetEase is the second biggest game company in China. At NetEase, I firstly came into contact with the job of technical art.
											On this internship, I was asked to use commercial game engines to achieve the effect of visual designer in the pre-research for the project's demo, I found that such big game projects require a lot of job posts with a variety of expertise for subtasks.
											Therefore, I am motivated to learn a wide range of topics in game development.
										</p>

										<p>
											After I graduated from ShanghaiTech in July 2020, I become a technique artist of User Research Department in NetEase Shanghai now. In my current job as a TA, I begin to use the home-grown game engine of NetEase. After participating in several tasks of online production,
											although some productions are famous in this industry, I find many limitations and inefficiencies works in current game production pipeline. So, I aspire to make games in a more flexible way. Thus, I will pursue a graduate study to gain advanced knowledge and develop new techniques.
