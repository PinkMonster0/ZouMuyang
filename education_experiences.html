										<h1><a>Education</a></h1>
										<p>
											<span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
											In 2016, I entered Shanghaitech University, majoring in computer science. After the first year's basic computer science courses, I got interested in coding, especially on projects with beautiful visual effect. In spare time, I also learned the skills of using game engines by myself.
											After that, I made sure my aspiration in Computer Graphics and Game Development. I actively participated in the game technical lectures and gamejams. Also, I took several electives in Computer Graphics and Computer Vision.
											These courses and activities helped me to find my interest in rendering technique.
										</p>

										<p>
											Art is another interest of mine. Fortunately, ShanghaiTech founded the School of Creativity and Art(SCA) in 2017. I was among the first group of students who took courses of SCA. During the whole college time, I had taken Western Art History, Entertainment Design,
											User Experience Design and many other courses. And I became the teaching assistant of Experimental Animation course in Spring 2019.
										</p>

										<h1><a>Internship</a></h1>

										<p>
 											Beyond the courses, I tried to find opportunities to work in game industry.In the summer of 2018, I got my first practice opportunity in Shanghai Hyron Software.
											I worked as level designer intern in a game studio of Hyron for two months, produced a project named 'Little Fist Combat'.Unfortunately, this game did not make it to the market due to the game license issues.
											Nevertheless, I learned the operations of a small game studio in China through this internship experience.

											Because of winning the First Prize of NetEase College Mini Game Competetion, I got a technical artist intern offer in 2019 summer. NetEase is the second biggest game company in China. At NetEase, I firstly came into contact with the job of technical art.
											On this internship, I was asked to use commercial game engines to achieve the effect of visual designer in the pre-research for the project's demo, I found that such big game projects require a lot of job posts with a variety of expertise for subtasks.
											Therefore, I am motivated to learn a wide range of topics in game development.
										</p>

										<h1><a>Employment</a></h1>
										<p>
											After graduating from Shanghaitech University, I joined User Experience Center in NetEase Shanghai and became a Technical Artist. During my time there, I was involved as a team member in several ongoing projects.
											My responsibilities involved reproducing artistic designs within the game engine and assisting in the development of camera systems and animation scripts.

										<p>
											Additionally, I also provided middle-platform support for famous online projects like
											"Tomorrow After Life," "The Eternal 7-Day Capital," and "Diablo Immortal"
										</p>

										<p>
											It's worth mentioning that much of the work at NetEase Games was done using in-house game engines (Messiah and NeoX).
											As a Technical Artist, I collaborated closely with game engine developers, testing new engine features and suggesting modifications.
											I also created demonstration demos for new engine versions.

											In early 2022, I followed my leader to Lilith Games.
											At that time, Lilith was planning to establish a technical research and development platform, and our team met their expectations.
											Initially, we were placed in the "Art of Conouest 2" project team.
											After successfully iterating for the project, we joined the newly formed Lilith Technology Middle Platform.

										<p>
											Within this middle platform, according to the technical expertise accumulated at NetEase and previous experiences,
											our team developed a set of tools called UEP for UI and effects production.
											This tool significantly improved the quality and standardization of effects.
											During this process, I directly participated in the development of "AFK:Journey" and "Bora Bora" as a team member.
											As the projects were still in the development phase, I'm unable to provide details.
											The following information is sourced from public data available online.
